Abstract
Cooperative AI is an emerging field of research within systemic safety research that investigates how AI systems and humans can effectively work together. As AI systems become more sophisticated, understanding their cooperative behaviors becomes crucial, particularly in complex social scenarios involving negotiation and persuasion. This study employs Google DeepMind's Concordia framework to evaluate AI agents' cooperative capabilities across diverse text-based environments. The agents were implemented as predictors of narratives and used this to reflect and analyze their current situation and make decisions to drive the situation for mutual/individual benefit, depending on the environment. Agents were tested across four environment types: reality show scenarios, pub coordination tasks, haggling scenarios and labor collective simulations. Results demonstrated that pre-normalization performance varied significantly across environments, with highest scores in reality show scenarios and lower performance in pub coordination and labor collective tasks. These findings suggest that environmental context substantially influences cooperative behavior, with implications for designing more generalized cooperative AI systems showing Pareto-optimal behavior across all environments.
